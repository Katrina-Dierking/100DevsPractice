Note to self. 

Day 1 (March 9): I've fallen behind but today is the day I get more disciplined and focused. I WILL get another dev job. 

Day 2 (March 10): Going back to HTML/CSS and realizing how much I forget or missed before. Feeling confident. 

Day 3 (March 11) Continuing on. I'd forgotten how much I enjoy coding. With so much time passing since I was laid off, I've stepped away to deal with family issues, deaths, and illnesses. Now I'm ready to return to my first love.
