Note to self. 

Day 1 (March 9): I've fallen behind but today is the day I get more disciplined and focused. I WILL get another dev job. 

Day 2 (March 10): Going back to HTML/CSS and realizing how much I forget or missed before. Feeling confident. 

Day 3 (March 11) Continuing on. I'd forgotten how much I enjoy coding. With so much time passing since I was laid off, I've stepped away to deal with family issues, deaths, and illnesses. Now I'm ready to return to my first love. 

Day 4 (March 13) Class 8 today. Writing "bad code". I can't believe how much I'm learning even after being an engineer for some time. I love learning new things. I WILL have a job by September 22, 2023 and being able to learn new things each day is going to get me there. 

    *** TIP for the day: "don't give up in silence. Ask for help!!!" This has always been the greatest issue for me. I will get better at this. 

Day 5 (March 14) Class 9 and 10 today. Today we talk about networking, which I'm not so good at. I can be a painful introvert though I'm a functional extrovert. I intend to get better at this and find the confidence I once I had in myself. This a new beginning for me. 

Finished the 9-11 classes and moved onto Class 12 (JavaScript - YAY!!)
