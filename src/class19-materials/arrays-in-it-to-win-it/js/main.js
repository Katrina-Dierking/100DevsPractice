//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

const movies = ["cars", "jumangi", "frozen"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

console.log(movies[0])

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

const newMovies = movies.length;
console.log(newMovies)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

const watchThis = movies[movies.length-1]
console.log(watchThis)
